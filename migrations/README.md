The project is using ES Module syntax for the JS code. However, the `umzug` library that Sequelize.js uses to manage migrations is currently not fully compatible with ES modules. Therefore we added a separate package.json file here to trick compiler to compile migration files that is in CommonJS format. We should update the migration file syntax once sequelize can support ES Module for migration.
